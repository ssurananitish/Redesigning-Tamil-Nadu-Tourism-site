# Redesigning Tamil Nadu Tourism site

As tourism is one of the fastest growing industries today, thus within the tourism industry events are getting more and more important. People have become more interested in events of all kinds and will travel far away to participate in events that they find interesting. Events can offer various economic and social benefits for destinations, and therefore tourism sites play a major role in attracting crowds towards itself. It has become widely accepted that every community and destination need to adopt a long-term, strategic approach to event tourism thereby planning and development in order to realize the full tourism potential of events. Therefore, for the economic success of these events, the respective tourism site needs to provide a proper user interface, and user-friendly design along with proper animations and themes to convince the user to attend these events. This project’s main aim is to redesign the Tamil Nadu Tourism site and convert it into a much more interactive and unique, so that it can attract various kinds of people from all over the globe towards the respective state and hence by increase the overall tourism in the state.

There are various drawbacks in the current Tourism site. They are: -
➢ The site is very plain in nature with a bad theme setting.
➢ Bad user-interface.
➢ The pictures displayed on the site are not provided in the best quality.
➢ The content that is provided for some tourism places are old and not up to date.
➢ Very less usage of animation in the site and hence unable to attract crowds.
➢ Takes a large amount of time to load fully.
➢ The visual experience that the user can get from exploring the site is way less compared to other state tourism sites like Rajasthan (http://www.tourism.rajasthan.gov.in), Madhya Pradesh (http://www.mptourism.com), Bihar (http://www.bihartourism.gov.in) etc. Therefore, people tend to visit these states more than they would think of visiting Tamil Nadu.


There are various advantages of the new redesigned site over the old site. They are:
➢ Better User-interface.
➢ Updated Content for respective Tourism sites.
➢ High Quality images to be displayed for tourism sites.
➢ Use of animations to create much more interactive website design.
➢ The site will load faster compared to the present site.
➢ The remodelled site can attract same number of Tourists with respect to the tourism sites that are provided by states such as Rajasthan.
